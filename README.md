# web_scrapping_super-broccoli

This is a simple project where I used Python and it's lib Pandas to retrieve data from a online store called Kabum.

The idea was to get all model names, price and links to office chairs (click url link to access).

At the end, the app should provide an excel file with these data (check arquivoScrapping.xlsx).

This project was meant for learning purpose.
